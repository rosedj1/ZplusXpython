Elisa has 631 unique 3P1F events.
I have managed to use the HZZ Analyzer on 226 of them.
Many times the Analyzer just doesn't process the event.
Often times I get disconnected and the bash script
(`sidequests/scripts/run_HZZAna_singleevent_in_bkg.sh`)
doesn't process completely.

Try to run it on a `screen`.

TODO:
[ ] Process the rest of the events.
[ ] Reprocess the bad root files are the ones with < 90 KB in size.
